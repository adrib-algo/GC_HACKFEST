  'Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development',
  `The objective is to create an AI-driven decision support system that determines real-time soil properties (pH, moisture, nutrient content) based on satellite data (e.g., Soil Grids, Bhuvan APIs) or IoT sensors. The system must also account for localised weather forecasts, past crop rotation data to preserve soil fertility, and existing market demand and price trends obtained through APIs or scraping agri-market websites.

A machine learning model will provide the most appropriate crops for specified conditions, forecasting yield, profit margins, and sustainability scores. The solution should comprise a mobile application with a simple multilingual interface where farmers can enter or retrieve relevant data, see recommendations, and operate offline in low-connectivity regions.`

  'AI enabled cyber incident & safety web portal for defence.',
  'Blockchain & Cybersecurity',
  `Background
1.1. In the evolving threat landscape, cyber adversaries are increasingly focusing on the personal devices and digital footprints of defence personnel, their families, and ex-servicemen.
1.2. These individuals constitute prime and high-value targets; exploitation of their personal communications, social interactions, or financial activity can escalate into espionage, honeytraps, identity compromise, or targeted malware intrusions.
1.3. At present, complaints are routed through the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal (NCRP), which is overloaded with civilian cases.
1.4. As the NCRP does not accord any priority to defence-related complaints, incidents with potential national security implications may remain undetected or delayed in response, thereby increasing operational risk.
1.5. A dedicated AI-driven cyber incident portal is therefore required to ensure faster detection, timely triage, and controlled escalation for defence-linked cases.

Problem Description
2.1. The proposed solution is an AI-enabled Defence Cyber Incident & Safety Portal, designed exclusively for serving personnel, their families, and veterans.
2.2. The portal must serve as a secure intake, triage, and alerting mechanism for cyber complaints with a direct linkage to CERT-Army.
2.3. The system should:-
2.3.1. Accept multi-format forensic samples (suspicious text messages, URLs, images, audio, video, and files).
2.3.2. Analyze inputs using AI/ML models to identify malicious content, espionage patterns, or targeted threat campaigns.
2.3.3. Provide real-time alerts and recommended mitigation steps to the complainant.
2.3.4. Generate segregated, priority- and risk-wise lists of incidents for CERT-Army, enabling swift and structured response.
2.3.5 Maintain role-based access controls, strict audit trails, and compliance with defence data-security norms.`

  'Heritage & Culture',
  `Currently, crowd management in pilgrimage sites is handled through manual monitoring, local police deployment, barricades, and traditional queue systems. These approaches often fall short during peak seasons when lakhs of devotees gather simultaneously. Key issues include:
▪ Overcrowding & Queue Management – Long waiting times, lack of real-time queue visibility, and bottlenecks during entry/exit.
▪ Safety & Emergency Response – Risk of stampedes, medical emergencies, and insufficient early warning mechanisms.
▪ Traffic & Mobility Challenges – Congested approach roads, parking shortages, and inefficient flow of vehicles.
▪ Pilgrim Guidance & Communication – Limited digital tools to provide real-time updates on waiting times, temple darshan slots, or emergency alerts.
▪ Resource Optimization – Lack of AI-driven tools for predicting peak crowds and deploying security/medical staff accordingly.
▪ Inclusivity & Accessibility – Inadequate solutions for elderly, women, children, and differently-abled devotees.

Without integrated smart systems, it becomes difficult to balance religious traditions, safety, and modern-day visitor expectations.`

  `The current scheduling mechanism in most higher education institutes/colleges relies on manual input via spreadsheets or basic tools. These fail to account for real-time availability of faculty, room capacity, teaching load norms, subject combinations, and student preferences. A solution is required that will accommodate the various parameters required for scheduling classes for UG and PG students and return an optimized timetable ensuring:
• Maximized utilization of classrooms and laboratories
• Minimized workload on faculty members and students
• Achievement of required learning outcomes

Key Parameters

The following parameters can be taken into account as variables for creating optimized timetables:
- Number of classrooms available
- Number of batches of students
- Number of subjects to be taught in a particular semester
- Names of subjects
- Maximum number of classes per day
- Number of classes to be conducted for a subject per week / per day
- Number of faculties available for different subjects
- Average number of leaves a faculty member takes in a month

  `Background:
Campus offices answer hundreds of repetitive queries—fee deadlines, scholarship forms, timetable changes—often from students more comfortable in Hindi or other regional languages. Long queues and communication gaps strain both staff and learners.

Description:
While answers reside in circulars and PDFs, students prefer conversational guidance. A multilingual chatbot that understands Hindi, English, and an additional local language can deflect routine inquiries, freeing staff for complex tasks. Modern conversational AI services offer drag-and-drop interfaces. Key requirements include accurate intent recognition, context management across multiple turns, fallback to human contact when necessary, and daily conversation logs for continuous improvement. Embedding the chatbot on the college website and popular messaging platforms maximises reach. Crucially, the solution must respect privacy, ensure response accuracy, and remain maintainable by student volunteers after the hackathon concludes. By focusing on content curation and user-centric design, participants can deliver high impact solution quickly.`

  'Development of a Smart Digital Platform to Promote Eco & Cultural Tourism in India',
  'Travel & Tourism',
  `Background
India is home to a vast and diverse range of eco-tourism destinations, cultural heritage sites, tribal traditions, historical landmarks, and natural landscapes spread across its states and union territories. From forests, waterfalls, and hill regions to heritage towns, tribal villages, and spiritual centers, the country possesses immense tourism potential.

Despite this richness, many eco-tourism and cultural destinations remain under-promoted and under-visited due to fragmented digital presence, lack of reliable information, limited visibility of local experiences, and unorganized travel and hospitality services—especially in non-metro and rural regions.

Description
Tourists often struggle to find authentic, trustworthy, and consolidated information related to eco and cultural tourism destinations across India. Information about local transportation, accommodations, seasonal attractions, cultural events, community-led experiences, and verified local guides is scattered or unavailable.

At the same time, local artisans, tribal communities, homestay owners, eco-tourism operators, and small service providers who could benefit directly from tourism are often excluded from mainstream digital platforms. This results in lost economic opportunities for local communities and limits the growth of responsible and sustainable tourism.

There is a strong need for a centralized, smart digital platform that promotes eco and cultural tourism across India by providing reliable destination information, enhancing tourist experience, and digitally connecting local communities and service providers. The platform should encourage responsible travel, cultural preservation, community participation, and sustainable tourism development at a national scale.`
